        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/team_MIS.jpg"

        <p>
          This report will document the development of front and rear suspension outboard components, as well as 
          regenerative braking improvements (regen). The developments fall under the chassis side of the team, 
          specifically suspension department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front outboard is primarily responsible for steering and (a large portion of) braking, rear outboard is 
          primarily responsible for acceleration and (a smaller portion of) braking, while the friction brakes and 
          regen straddle in between front and rear.
        </p>
        <p>
        Vehicle dynamics is not the focus of this report, but basic understanding of some VD concepts will be required 
        to justify the design decisions made.

        <h3>1.2 Result From Last Season</h3>
        <p>
          R25e finished 7th out of 86 teams at the FSAE Michigan competition, a stellar result that tied with the team’s 
          all-time best performance. Yet, it shared much of its suspension mechanical design with the previous car, 
          R24e. This is due to the short development cycle, as well as designs becoming increasingly matured. Small 
          incremental changes are safe, but stagnation is also a possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend to overhaul the component designs for this season, trading potential testing time for the opportunity 
          to implement different ideas that push past the bottlenecks. Many of the ideas have been thrown around in 
          suspension departments even with the previous cohorts, but they were not considered seriously. Given the time 
          crunch, my new designs will not drastically differ from that of my seniors, but I hope that experiences gained in trial 
          and error can provide valuable insights for future generations of suspension designers.

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h3>2.1. Front Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s front outboard design was unable to achieve a higher percentage of Ackermann steering, which has always 
          been identified as a design goal as it has the potential to provide greater cornering performance for the type 
          of tracks our cars must negotiate. This is mainly due to packaging constraints of the steering linkage.
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2. Rear Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s rear outboard design could not be downsized further, even though the load requirements are far below 
          the load capacities of the components. This is due to a combination of design and component choices, and as a 
          result there is potential for further weight savings.
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-3">
        <h3>2.3. Brakes</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s regen capabilities are not maximized, as the braking system had no means of actuating only the front 
          brakes. The loading of the brake pedal was also suboptimal due to the use of extreme brake bias settings.

        <p>
          The overall team goal for R26e is to decrease lap time by 10% through imporved reliability. While the team 
          goal mainly concerns the powertrain departments, I intend to contribute towards the 10% lap time reduction 
          by 
          <strong>designing a set of lightweight outboard components for the syspension system that satisfy geometry 
          requirements.</strong>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-1">
        <h3>5.1. Front Outboard</h3>
        <p>The challenge faced by the previous iterations of NUS FSAE race cars is that of packaging. The steering 
          clevis is located on the front of the upright for a few reasons, and even though the morphological chart 
          includes 4 variations of packaging, 2 are inferior based on the mounting location of the brake calliper.
        </p>
        <p>This is because during a braking event, the ground will exert a force on the front tyres both in the normal 
          direction (due to weight and load transfer) and longitudinal direction (due to friction). The resultant force 
          points upwards and towards the rear of the car. If the brake calliper is placed on the lower trailing side of 
          the upright, it will produce a force that partially cancels the force exerted by the ground, leading to lower 
          loads on the hub and hub bearings. This will lead to lighter hub designs and longer lasting bearings. 
          Conversely, placing the calliper on the leading side of the upright will add to the force exerted by the 
          ground, causing higher loads.
        </p>
        <p>Of the other 2 possibilities, steering actuation from the front was used because it better aligned with the 
          steering rack and allows for easier packaging. The drawback is that higher Ackermann percentage cannot be 
          achieved, as the steering pickup point will clash with the brake rotor.
        </p>
        <p>As a result, R25e’s Ackermann percentage drops to below 80% as the steering angle reaches maximum, requiring 
          1.5° of static toe out to compensate (which has its own implications).
        </p>
        <p>The solution is then to move steering actuation to the rear and integrate the mounting of the steering clevis 
          with that of the brake callipers. This was made possible also by a 30mm wheelbase increase, which better 
          aligns the steering rack. Actuating steering from the rear allows for more freedom in linkage placement, and 
          R26e manages to maintain its Ackerman percentage above 90 for the entire range of steering.
        </p>

      
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/r25ackermann.png"

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/r26ackermann.png"
          subtitle="Image ?: R26e Ackermann"></image-component>
        

        <p>The largest hurdle to overcome is packaging. The requirement to maintain the location of the brake callipers 
          meant that the steering clevis has little space available for mounting, and an entirely new upright had to be 
          designed to accommodate all of the components. FEA was employed to analyse the strength of the components, 
          which will be explained in a later segment.
        </p>
        <p>The steering clevis is secured to the upright using X2 bolts and blind threaded holes, as opposed to bolts 
          and locknuts with through holes. The upright was designed with machining in mind, therefore the profile of 
          the upright as well as any lightening cuts are aligned with the principal axes as much as possible.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-2">
        <h3>5.2. Rear Outboard</h3>
        <p>Similar to the front outboard components, the design of the rear outboard components on NUS FSAE cars have 
          remained largely unchanged for the past few seasons. However, regen has matured to the point where rear 
          brakes are becoming increasingly over-specced, and the weight saving efforts are also blocked by the minimum 
          size of wheel bearings available.
        </p>
        <p>Even on a car with no regen capabilities, majority of the braking is performed by the front axle due to load 
          transfer. When paired with regen, a rear-wheel-drive car like R25e is able to produce enough braking torque 
          on the rear axle without ever activating the friction brakes. 
        </p>
        <p>When we examine Motec data from testing, we can see that the rear rotor only heats up to about 100C with 
          regen implementation, which is covered in the next segment. Realistically, the rear brakes will only be 
          heavily leaned upon during the brake test, which removes the need to consider the effects of thermal strain.
        </p>
        <p>The rear hub bearings on R25e are angular contact ball bearings with ID of 70mm and OD of 100mm. These 
          bearings are used in pairs to provide rigidity against moments generated by the tyres due to cornering and 
          normal forces. On paper, the load capacity of these bearing far exceeds the loads that R25e can generate 
          during operation, yet we are not able to downsize the bearings as the hub cannot be further shrunken (at 
          least not with the existing design).
        </p>
        <p>The rear brake rotors are also oversized, which is caused by the large wheel bearings and the choice of 
          calliper. Radially mounted ISR callipers were used for their lightweight, but the mounting mechanism forced 
          the callipers to be mounted further away from the wheel centre, necessitating a larger diameter rotor.
        </p>
        <p>To solve this problem, a new hub design is being implemented where the profile of the hub is cut down to the 
          bare minimum without clashing with the half shaft tripod. This lowered the required ID of the hub bearing to 
          60mm, but the design does generate some concerns regarding the strength of the preload plate. An extensive 
          study on the design of the preload plate was then conducted, resulting in a slightly heavier but sufficiently 
          strong design. The simulation setup will also be covered later.
        </p>
        <p>NSK is currently a sponsor of the NUS FSAE team, and they offer bearings of the specified size in their catalogue. 
          The bearings also exceed the load specifications, but further downsizing would require completely different 
          methods of transmitting torque to the outboard. For now, NSK’s 7912 series are the smallest hub bearings that 
          can be used.
        </p>
        <p>A new style of calliper is also used. Axially mounted AP callipers (of the same overall weight) further 
          reduced the required size of the rotor, resulting in a reduction in diameter from 188mm to 172mm. The design 
          of the rotors will not be covered in the interim report.
        </p>
        <p>All of the component and design changes resulted in significant weight savings, which will be covered in the 
          segment on design outcomes.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-3">
        <h3>5.3. Brakes and Regen</h3>
        <p>R25e marks the first time that regen became effective. The regen logic works as such:
          <p style="margin-left: 50px;">  
          1. Determine the ideal brake balance at various speeds.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
          2. Bias the brakes to the front, which results in a shortfall in rear brakes line pressure.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px;">
          3. Compute the amount of regen required to match that ideal brake bias at that given speed and send 
          negative torque command to motor.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>However, there are still teething issues with the system, both in terms of regen efficiency and physical 
          design. Due to the design of the balance bar, it is not possible to divert all of the braking force to the 
          front axle, resulting in the rear brakes being actuated even though regen is capable of braking the rear 
          axle on its own. As mentioned in the previous segment, some heating of the rear rotor is still observed, 
          which means that regen has not recuperated all of the available energy.
        </p>
        <p>In order to send the most braking force to the front and maximize regen, extreme bias settings were also 
          used. This caused twisting in the brake pedal box assembly, and even though the components designed by our 
          team survived the season thanks to rigorous FEA, the ones bought off the shelf are much worse for wear.
        </p>
        <p>R26e will use an electronic shutoff valve, which when energized cuts off hydraulic pressure to the rear. It 
          is a normally open valve, so that in the event of loosing GLV, the system will continue to allow fluid flow. 
          When the driver presses the brake pedal and front line pressure builds up, the valve will be activated. This 
          will stop the pressure in the rear line from increasing, allowing for more regen.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, a more neutral balance bar position can be used, and twisting of the pedal can be reduced. 
          Master cylinder choices will also be opened up, as the old car also relied on bore sizes of master cylinders 
          to strike a balance between still being able to pass brake test and being able to send more braking force to 
          the front. With the ability to cut off the rear brakes, the hydraulics can be designed to optimize for more 
          equal loading of the pedal box instead.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Analysis</h2>
      </div>
      <p>All component designs are validated in Ansys FEA. The requirement for FOS is 2.0, as it strikes a balance 
        between development time and weight savings. Load cases are computed using excel based on physical properties 
        of the car, and the breakdown of the optimization & analysis results is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>It needs to be mentioned that the purpose of the simulation is to study the behaviour of the components under 
        worst case conditions, i.e. with no fastener tension or friction. Tyres are also taken to be operating outside 
        of the G-G diagram as we have no way of extrapolating the actual operating limits of the car and applying a 
        realistic load case.
      </p>
      <p>The weight calculation at this point is based on mass in Solidworks and product specifications. This will be 
        checked again during assembly phase. Some of the components fall below the target FOS of 2.0, but this is due to 
        stress singularities. Bolt holes and sharp transitions are usually the cause, and results that fall short of 
        the target FOS were individually examined to determine the reason.
      </p>
      <p>The components also went through multiple design iterations and sometimes complete overhauls as some concepts 
        proved to be not feasible. Notably, the rear hub design received additional attention as it is a simulation that 
        has not been performed on R25e. With the new rear hub design, it is unwise to proceed with design without 
        validation.
      </p>
      <p>As a result, a new simulation was set up to investigate the design of the rear hub and preload plate. Since the 
        hub’s profile is now broken up into 3 islands instead of a continuous circumference, the effects of torque 
        exerted by the tripod needs to be studied. Simulation results show that under extreme loads, the FOS of the hub 
        falls to 1.3 due to the limitations of the model. The quarter car model could not be modified to converge, and 
        the simulation instead constrain the upright in space, causing excessive force to be transmitted through the 
        hub [WIP]

        <h2>7. Design Outcome</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-7-header-1">
        <h3>7.1. Value Proposition</h3>
        <p>The new changes bring about higher sustained Ackermann steering percentage, lighter overall weight and 
        improved regen head room, satisfying the goal of designing lightweight components that support the desired 
        geometry. It is hoped that we would be able to verify the effects of higher Ackermann, and that the shutoff 
        valve works reliably.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-7-header-2">
        <h3>7.2. Limitations</h3>
        
      <p>There are some potential drawbacks to the new designs, as previously described by the scoring table. The front 
        suspension has much tighter packaging, which can make installation of parts tricky. However, this will only 
        become a problem during initial assembly and in the event of a rebuild, hence the impact is still minor.
      </p>
      <p>The new rear hub design allows for significant weight savings, but manufacturing and assembly also becomes 
        more complicated. Specifically, bearing tolerance is something that needs to be controlled more tightly, as 
        excessively tight press fit can cause much more damage to the islands compared to a hub that has the full 
        circumference of the profile. As such, a tight sliding fit of h6 is called for.
      </p>
      <p>The addition of the shutoff valve brings with it more hydraulic connections, which are point of failures. 
        The NPT inlet and outlet that come with the shutoff valve can be difficult to install correctly due to the 
        tapered threads, and utmost care is required to ensure that there is no leak.

        <h2>8. Future Works</h2>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-8-header-1">
        <h3>8.1. Gantt Chart</h3>
        <p>The short-term goal of this project is to assemble the car for testing and validation. At the time of 
          writing, the component designs have been finalized, and machining drawings are being produced. Manufacturing 
          will begin shortly after, and all components will be received around Jan 2026. 
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-8-header-2">
        <h3>8.2. Short Term Goals</h3>
        <p>Once the car can be assembled, testing agendas include data collection on the effects of Ackerman percentage 
          increase, validation and reliability testing of the shutoff valve, as well as general shakedown to ensure 
          that all components are performing as expected. There is also the plan to implement electronic brake bias 
          adjustments, as regen is expected to take over braking at the rear axle.
        </p>

      <div id="sub-section-8-header-3">
        <h3>8.3. Long Term Goals</h3>
        <p>In the long run, more work will be done on the detail design of the friction brake system. This will include 
          master cylinder selection, hydraulics, brake rotor design and simulation (structural & thermal). The goal is 
          to collect more data on real life brake thermal behaviour, as we have a limited simulation suite to perform 
          initial brake design. There are also existing shortcomings of the simulation model that have not been 
          resolved. These will be covered in the final report.

        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/team_MIS.jpg"
          subtitle="Image 1: NUS FSAE R25e Team at MIS"></image-component>
        <p>
          This report will document the development of front and rear suspension outboard components, as well as 
          regenerative braking improvements (regen). The developments fall under the chassis side of the team, 
          specifically suspension department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Front outboard is primarily responsible for steering and (a large portion of) braking, rear outboard is 
          primarily responsible for acceleration and (a smaller portion of) braking, while the friction brakes and 
          regen straddle in between front and rear.
        </p>
        <p>
        Vehicle dynamics is not the focus of this report, but basic understanding of some VD concepts will be required 
        to justify the design decisions made.

        <h3>1.2 Result From Last Season</h3>
        <p>
          R25e finished 7th out of 86 teams at the FSAE Michigan competition, a stellar result that tied with the team’s 
          all-time best performance. Yet, it shared much of its suspension mechanical design with the previous car, 
          R24e. This is due to the short development cycle, as well as designs becoming increasingly matured. Small 
          incremental changes are safe, but stagnation is also a possibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intend to overhaul the component designs for this season, trading potential testing time for the opportunity 
          to implement different ideas that push past the bottlenecks. Many of the ideas have been thrown around in 
          suspension departments even with the previous cohorts, but they were not considered seriously. Given the time 
          crunch, my new designs will not drastically differ from that of my seniors, but I hope that experiences gained in trial 
          and error can provide valuable insights for future generations of suspension designers.

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h3>2.1. Front Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s front outboard design was unable to achieve a higher percentage of Ackermann steering, which has always 
          been identified as a design goal as it has the potential to provide greater cornering performance for the type 
          of tracks our cars must negotiate. This is mainly due to packaging constraints of the steering linkage.
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2. Rear Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s rear outboard design could not be downsized further, even though the load requirements are far below 
          the load capacities of the components. This is due to a combination of design and component choices, and as a 
          result there is potential for further weight savings.
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-3">
        <h3>2.3. Brakes</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s regen capabilities are not maximized, as the braking system had no means of actuating only the front 
          brakes. The loading of the brake pedal was also suboptimal due to the use of extreme brake bias settings.

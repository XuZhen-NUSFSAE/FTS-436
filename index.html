        <h2> Foreword </h2>
      </div>
      <p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude toward my mentors, seniors and colleagues for all that they have done 
        over the last season. It is hard to articulate how grateful I am towards them, and I will forever be in debt given 
        all that they have done.
      </p>
      <p>My senior for the 25 season, Pei Herng, was the largest positive influence to me and the inspiration for our 
        entire team to align our focus for the 26 season: fundamentals. Understanding the physics behind the car, and 
        being unbiased when making decisions goes a long way in preventing tunnel visioning and nepotism. In times where 
        personal agendas threatened progress, Pei Herng pressed on and persevered until the end, never losing 
        sight of what is right.
      </p>
      <p>I hope to emulate the righteous spirit that Pei Herng embodies, and together with my colleague Sam, we begin 
        work on NUS FSAE's next car, R26e.
      </p>

        <h3>1.1 Team Structure & Scope of Report</h3>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/team_MIS.jpg" style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px"
          subtitle="Image 1: NUS FSAE R25e Team at MIS"></image-component>
        <p>
          This report will document the development of the front and rear suspension outboard components, as well as 
          regenerative braking improvements (regen) on the R26e race car. The developments fall under the chassis side of the team, 
          specifically suspension.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of functions, front outboard is primarily responsible for steering and (a large portion of) braking, rear outboard is 
          primarily responsible for acceleration and (a smaller portion of) braking, while the friction brakes and 
          regenerative braking (regen) straddle in between front and rear.
        </p>
        <p>
        Vehicle dynamics is not the focus of this report, but basic understanding of some VD concepts will be required 
        to justify the design decisions made. Brake rotor design also will not be covered, as that will be the scope for 
        my final report.

        <h3>1.2 Result From Last Season</h3>
        <p>
          R25e finished 7th out of 86 teams at the FSAE Michigan competition, a stellar result that tied with the team’s 
          all-time best performance. Yet, it shared much of its suspension mechanical design with the previous car, 
          R24e. This is due to the short development cycle, as well as designs becoming increasingly matured. Small 
          incremental changes are safe, but stagnation is also a possibility.
        </p>

          subtitle="Image 3: Design of R24e and R25e's outboard components"></image-component>
        <p>
          I intend to overhaul the component designs for this season, trading potential testing time for the opportunity 
          to implement different ideas that push past the bottlenecks. Many of the ideas have been thrown around in 
          suspension departments even with the previous cohorts, but they were not considered seriously. Given the time 
          crunch, my new designs will not drastically differ from that of my seniors, but I hope that experiences gained in trial 
          and error can provide valuable insights for future generations of suspension designers.

      <div id="sub-section-2-header-1">
        <h3>2.1. Front Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s front outboard design was unable to achieve a higher sustained percentage of Ackermann steering 
          [appendix 1] due to packaging constraints of 
          the steering linkage, 
          although Ackermann was identified as a design goal as it has the potential to provide greater cornering 
          performance for the type of tracks our cars must negotiate. 
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-2">
        <h3>2.2. Rear Outboard</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s rear outboard design could not be downsized further, even though the load requirements are far below 
          the load capacities of the components. This is due to a combination of design and component choices, and as a 
          result there is unfulfilled potential for weight savings.
        </p>


      <div id="sub-section-2-header-3">
        <h3>2.3. Brakes</h3>
        <p>
          R25e’s regen capabilities are not maximized, as the braking system had no means of actuating only 
          the front brakes. The loading of the brake pedal was also suboptimal due to the use of extreme brake bias 
          settings.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Design Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The overall team goal for R26e is to decrease lap time by 10% through improved reliability. While the team 
          goal mainly concerns the powertrain departments, I intend to contribute towards the 10% lap time reduction 
          by 
          <strong>designing a set of lightweight outboard components for the suspension system that satisfy geometry 
          requirements.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        The new changes would bring about higher sustained Ackermann steering percentage, which will allow us to 
        investigate the effects of higher Ackermann percentage. Static toe was used to increase the Ackermann percentage
        at higher steering angles, but static toe out leads to more drag and should be used sparingly.
        Outboard components will be lightened, leading to
        lighter unsprung mass which benefits ride performance (Gillespie, 1991) [appendix 2].
        Regen head room will be also improved.

          subtitle="Image 4: Morphological chart"></image-component>
        <p>Various design and component choices were experimented with, each with their unique traits [appendix 3]. 3 
          Concepts were generated. Concept 1 serves as the benchmark and is representative of R25e. Concept 2 is the 
          set of designs that were chosen for R26e. Concept 3 is a collection of experimental designs that ultimately 
          failed to satisfy the selection criterion.

          subtitle="Image 5: Scoring of concepts"></image-component>
        <p>The main requirements listed in my overall design goal are weight and geometry, but other factors are also 
          considered. Concepts are scored according to whether they managed to fulfill the desired requirements. Concept 2 was 
          chosen over the alternatives, as it only sacrifices some ease of assembly while achieving the goals 
          of light weight and geometry, which will be explained in the following section on detail design. As to what
          the criteria entail, the next segment will elaborate further.

        <p>The components listed above are:
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">  
          1. Steering clevis
          </p>

          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          3. Front Upright
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          4. Wheel speed sensor
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          5. Camber clevis
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>The challenge faced by the previous iterations of NUS FSAE race cars is that of packaging. The steering 
          clevis is located on the front of the upright for a few reasons, and even though the morphological chart 
          includes 4 variations of packaging, 2 are inferior based on the mounting location of the brake calliper.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/brakeforces.png"
          subtitle="Image 8: Forces during braking"></image-component>
        <p>This is because during a braking event, the ground will exert a force on the front tyres both in the 
          <span style = "color:deepskyblue">normal 
          direction</span> (due to weight and load transfer) and 
          <span style = "color:blueviolet">longitudinal direction</span> (due to friction). 
          The <span style = "color:green">resultant force</span>  
          points upwards and towards the rear of the car. If the brake calliper is placed on the lower trailing side of 
          the upright, it will produce a <span style = "color:red">friction force</span>
           that partially cancels the force exerted by the ground, leading to lower 
          loads on the hub and hub bearings. This will lead to lighter hub designs and longer lasting bearings. 
          Conversely, placing the calliper on the leading side of the upright will add to the force exerted by the 
          ground, causing higher loads. [appendix 4]
        </p>
        <p>Of the other 2 possibilities, steering actuation from the front was used because it better aligned with the 
          steering rack and allows for easier packaging. The drawback is that higher Ackermann percentage cannot be 
          achieved, as the steering pickup point will clash with the brake rotor.
        </p>

          subtitle="Image 10: R25e Ackermann"></image-component>
        <br>

        <p>As a result, R25e’s Ackermann percentage drops to below 80% as the steering angle reaches maximum, requiring 
          1.5° of static toe out to compensate, resulting in additional drag in the straights and heats up the tyres 
          excessively
          (Milliken, 1995).
        </p>
        <p>On R26e, steering actuation is moved to the rear and the mounting of the steering clevis is integrated
          with that of the brake callipers. This was made possible also by a 30mm wheelbase increase, which better 
          aligns the steering rack. Actuating steering from the rear allows for more freedom in linkage placement, and 
          R26e manages to maintain its Ackermann percentage above 90 for the entire range of steering.
        </p>

        <p>The largest hurdle to overcome is packaging. The requirement to maintain the location of the brake callipers 
          meant that the steering clevis has little space available for mounting, and an entirely new upright had to be 
          designed to accommodate all of the components. FEA was employed to analyse the strength of the components, 
          which will be explained in a later segment.

        <p>The steering clevis is secured to the upright using X2 bolts and blind threaded holes, as opposed to bolts 
          and locknuts with through holes. The upright was designed with machining in mind, therefore the profile of 
          the upright as well as any lightening cuts are aligned with the principal axes as much as possible.

          remained largely unchanged for the past few seasons. However, regen has matured to the point where rear 
          brakes are becoming increasingly over-specced, and the weight saving efforts are also blocked by the minimum 
          size of wheel bearings available.
        </p>
        <p>Even on a car with no regen capabilities, majority of the braking is performed by the front axle due to load 
          transfer. When paired with regen, a rear-wheel-drive car like R25e is able to produce enough braking torque 
          on the rear axle without ever activating the friction brakes. 
        </p>

          subtitle="Image 16: Motec data showing low rear brake temperatures"></image-component>
        <p>When we examine Motec data from testing, we can see that the rear rotor only heats up to about 100C with 
          regen implementation, which is covered in the next segment. Realistically, the rear brakes will only be 
          heavily leaned upon during the brake test, which removes the need to consider the effects of thermal strain.
        </p>
        <p>The rear hub bearings on R25e are angular contact ball bearings [appendix 5] with ID of 70mm and OD of 100mm. 
          These 
          bearings are used in pairs to provide rigidity against moments generated by the tyres due to cornering and 
          normal forces. On paper, the load capacity of these bearing far exceeds the loads that R25e can generate 
          during operation, yet we are not able to downsize the bearings as the hub cannot be further shrunken (at 
          least not with the existing design).

          profile"></image-component>
        <p>The rear brake rotors are also oversized, which is caused by the large wheel bearings and the choice of 
          calliper. Radially mounted ISR callipers were used for their lightweight, but the mounting mechanism forced 
          the callipers to be mounted further away from the wheel centre, necessitating a larger diameter rotor. On
          R25e, the rear rotor diameter was 188mm.

          the calliper outwards"></image-component>
        <p>To solve this problem, a new hub design is being implemented where the profile of the hub is cut down to the 
          bare minimum without clashing with the half shaft tripod. This lowered the required ID of the hub bearing to 
          60mm, but the design does generate some concerns regarding the strength of the preload plate. An extensive 
          study on the design of the preload plate was then conducted, resulting in a slightly heavier but sufficiently 
          strong design. The simulation setup will also be covered later.

        <p>NSK is currently a sponsor of the NUS FSAE team, and they offer bearings of the specified size in their catalogue. 
          The bearings also exceed the load specifications, but further downsizing would require completely different 
          methods of transmitting torque to the outboard. For now, NSK’s 7912 series are the smallest hub bearings that 
          can be used.

        <p>A new style of calliper is also used. Axially mounted AP callipers (of the same overall weight) further 
          reduced the required size of the rotor, resulting in a reduction in diameter from 188mm to 172mm. The design 
          of the rotors will not be covered in the interim report.

        <h3>5.3. Brakes and Regen</h3>
        <p>R25e marks the first time that regen became effective. The regen logic works as such:
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">  
          1. Determine the ideal brake balance at various speeds.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          2. Bias the brakes to the front, which results in a shortfall in rear brakes line pressure.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          3. Compute the amount of regen required to match that ideal brake bias at that given speed and send 
          negative torque command to motor.
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>However, there are still teething issues with the system, both in terms of regen efficiency and physical 
          design. Due to the design of the balance bar, it is not possible to divert all of the braking force to the 
          front axle, resulting in the rear brakes being actuated even though regen is capable of braking the rear 
          axle on its own. As mentioned in the previous segment, some heating of the rear rotor is still observed, 
          which means that regen has not recuperated all of the available energy.
        </p>
        <p>In order to send the most braking force to the front and maximize regen, extreme bias settings were also 
          used. This caused twisting in the brake pedal box assembly, and even though the components designed by our 
          team survived the season thanks to rigorous FEA, the ones bought off the shelf are much worse for wear.
        </p>

        </image-component>
        <p>R26e will use an electronic shutoff valve, which when energized cuts off hydraulic pressure to the rear. It 
          is a normally open valve, so that in the event of low voltage system failure, the system will continue to allow fluid flow. 
          When the driver presses the brake pedal and front line pressure builds up, the valve will be activated. This 
          will stop the pressure in the rear line from increasing, allowing for more regen.

        </image-component>
        <p>Additionally, a more neutral balance bar position can be used, and twisting of the pedal can be reduced. 
          Master cylinder choices will also be opened up, as the old car also relied on bore sizes of master cylinders 
          to strike a balance between still being able to pass brake test and being able to send more braking force to 
          the front. With the ability to cut off the rear brakes, the hydraulics can be designed to optimize for more 
          equal loading of the pedal box instead.

        <h2>6. Analysis</h2>
      </div>
      <p>All component designs are validated in Ansys FEA. The requirement for FOS (Factor of Safety) is 2.0, as it strikes a balance 
        between development time and weight savings. The weight calculation at this point is based on mass in 
        Solidworks and product specifications. This will be checked again during assembly phase. 
      </p>
      <p>Load cases are computed using excel based on physical properties of the car, and quarter car models were used 
        to validate component design. A total of 9 load cases are investigated, ranging from normal operating conditions 
        to worst-case-scenarios. Components that fail to reach FOS 2.0 are reinforced, and components exceeding FOS 2.0 
        are lightened. The breakdown of the optimization & analysis results is as follows, with a total weight saving of 
        0.6 kg:

      <p>It needs to be mentioned that the purpose of the simulation is to study the behaviour of the components under 
        worst case conditions, i.e. with no fastener tension or friction. Tyres are also taken to be operating outside 
        of the performance envelope as we have no way of extrapolating the actual operating limits of the car and applying a 
        realistic load case [appendix 6].
      </p>
      <p>The components also went through multiple design iterations and sometimes complete overhauls as some concepts 
        proved to be not feasible. Notably, the rear hub design received additional attention as it is a simulation that 
        has not been performed on R25e. In total, over 500 hours of simulation was performed for 15 setups of various types,
        adding up to 170,000 GB of writes and 70,000 GB of reads.

        <h2>7. Limitations</h2>
      </div>        
      <p>There are some potential drawbacks to the new designs, as previously described by the scoring table. The front 
        suspension has much tighter packaging, which can make installation of parts tricky. However, this will only 
        become a problem during initial assembly and in the event of a rebuild, hence the impact is still minor.
      </p>
      <p>The new rear hub design allows for significant weight savings, but manufacturing and assembly also becomes 
        more complicated. Specifically, bearing tolerance is something that needs to be controlled more tightly, as 
        excessively tight press fit can cause much more damage to the islands compared to a hub that has the full 
        circumference of the profile. As such, a tight sliding fit of h6 is called for.
      </p>
      <p>The addition of the shutoff valve brings with it more hydraulic connections, which are point of failures. 
        The NPT inlet and outlet [appendix 7] that come with the shutoff valve can be difficult to install correctly due to the 
        tapered threads, and utmost care is required to ensure that there is no leak.

      <h3>Appendix 1: Ackermann</h3>
      <p>Ackermann steering percentage is a measure of how well the vehicle’s steering follows the Ackermann steering 
        geometry. 100 percent Ackerman takes place when all of the wheels on the vehicles travel on paths that are 
        concentric to the sane point without any of the wheels scrubbing. This assumes that there is very low slip 
        angle at all wheels.
      </p>

      <image-component tag="image" source="assets/ackermann.png"
          subtitle="Image 29: Ackermann steering geometry (Milliken & Milliken, 1995)"></image-component>

      <p>The actual computation of Ackermann percentage will not be covered here, as it is much easier to use vehicles
        dynamic softwares such as OptimumK to calculate the value. The only takeaway is that Ackermann can describe the
        difference between how much each of the front wheels are steered.
      </p>

      <p>Pro-Ackermann steering tends to be used for race cars that have to traverse technical tracks where turn radii 
        are tight, and corner speeds are low. Examples include hill climb racing and FSAE. Yet, when consulting the 
        giants in the race car engineering space as to what is the best, many of the gurus also disagree on what should 
        be the correct answer. Carol Smith concluded that the racing car should probably have parallel steering, and 
        that it is not very critical anyway (Smith, 1978). On the other hand, Lars Frömmig argues that the type of 
        Ackermann should depend on the tire behaviour. If the peak lateral force of the tyre is achieved at the same 
        angle across all normal loads, parallel steering is desirable. If the ideal slip angle increases with normal 
        load, then anti-Ackermann should be used to steer the outside wheel more and produce that higher slip (since 
        that wheel will be more loaded). Lastly, tyres that have decreasing ideal slip angle with increasing normal 
        load favour pro-Ackermann (Frömmig, 2023). It is also worth noting that our tyres supposedly exhibit increasing 
        ideal slip angle as normal load increases.
      </p>

      <p>It would then be hard for me to draw any conclusion other than that the ideal Ackermann percentage would be 
        influenced by type data and vehicle dynamic models, as we need to predict the load that each tyre will 
        experience and match the tyres with the correct slip angles. 
      </p>

      <p>Without a reliable method of measuring slip angles and tyre loads on the actual vehicle, we have to use 
        intuition. At the speed that we traverse the track, and given the composition of the track, it would require 
        a few things:
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">  
          1. Large steering input. Tight corners simply mean that drivers have to steer more, and the effects of 
          Ackermann percentage will only become evident at higher steering input.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          2. Low speeds. Unless intentionally forced / unintentionally miscalculated, it is hard to induce large slip 
          angles on the car given how slow we are going (max 70kph and average 45kph). 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
          3. Strong initial turn-in. The lack of long sweeping corners and the high frequency of tight manoeuvres 
          prioritize faster directional change over sustained cornering capabilities.
          </p>
      </p>

      <p>All of this is to say that we would like to experiment with higher Ackermann percentage to investigate its 
        effects on lap time, and that we are setting pro-Ackermann steering geometry as a design goal.
      </p>


      <h3>Appendix 2: Unsprung mass</h3>
      <p>It is better to minimize the unsprung mass on a vehicle as this reduces road-to-body transmissibility 
        (Gillespie, 1991). There will be a point in the frequency range where the unsprung mass goes into resonance. 
        This will lead to degraded road holding performance. Therefore, we want to avoid having the unsprung mass 
        going into wheel hop, and having lighter unsprung 
        mass helps to reduce the response gain at mid to lower frequencies, which is exactly where our car operates. 
      </p>
      <image-component tag="image" source="assets/wheelhop.png"
          subtitle="Image 30: Graph showing the effects of unsprung mass on wheel hop responances
           (Gillespie, 1991)"></image-component>


      <h3>Appendix 3: Alternate design choices from morphological chart</h3>
      <p>the main roles of the front outboard components are to steer and brake. Almost all FSAE cars make use of some 
        form of rack and pinion steering, and almost all FSAE cars make use of multi-piston fixed brake callipers. The 
        question then becomes that of packaging, and which component should be placed at which location.
      </p>
      <p>For rear outboard components (especially for a rear-wheel drive car with a mechanical differential), their main 
        role is to transmit torque. This means that the hub must be able to receive the torque coming from the 
        differential, then pass it to the wheels and tyres. This is easier said than done, because the hub may move 
        in/outboard during suspension travel due to the motion of the upright as constrained by the suspension arms. 
        This means that the hub must be abled to move in/outboard, but be constrained to the rotation of the half shaft.

      <p>In terms of how the torque is sent to outboard, tractive and cooling department has the final say. Single 
        piece half shafts with tripod joints will be used, therefore the design of the rear hubs must be able to 
        accommodate. Typically, the profile of the tripod cup is machined into the hub, but there are also off-the-shelf 
        solutions such as this adaptor from Taylor Race Engineering. The reasons for integrating the tripod cup into 
        the hub are weight and size, as a much smaller and lighter hub can be designed.

      <h3>Appendix 4: Forces during braking</h3>
      <p>In order to make calculations easier, we will be representing forces in terms of G. When a braking event occurs,
        the ground will exert a frictional force on the tyre (purple). Our car can produce sustained braking force of 
        1.5 G , and for the sake of simplicity, we assume that all of this is done at the front wheels.
      </p>
      <p>Weight transfer also happens when brakes are applied, and we assume that the car has transferred all of 
        its weight to the front axle, hence 1 G of vertical force is appleid to the hub (blue). This force combine with
        the frictional force from the ground will give a resultant force that is about 1.8 G (green), pointed up and towards 
        the rear.
      </p>
      <p>We know that the placement of the calliper needs to be around the brake rotor, and we know that the force produced
        by the calliper needs to counteract the momement produced by the frictional force from the ground. Since the distance
        between the calliper (rotor mean diamter) is about half of that of the wheel diamter, the magnitude of the forced
        generated by the calliper will have to be 3 G (red).
      </p>
      <p>Where we choose to place the red force will then determine how mucch load the hubs and bearings will experience,
        and we can only choose a location that is tangent to the brake rotor. Of all the possible locations, placing 
        the callipers on the trailing side of the upright pointing towards the lower ball joint will producee the lowest 
        overall force.

      <h3>Appendix 5: Angular contact bearings</h3>
      <p>Angular contact bearings are a special type of ball bearings, where the inner and outter races contact that balls
        at an angle instead of perpendicular to the axis of rotation. These bearings are used in pairs for our case, and 
        they can support axial loads better than standard ball bearings.
      </p>
      <p>The arrangement used is back-to-back, as it provides more stability against any moment that may arise. Another 
        reason for choosing back to back is the method of mounting, as the bearing are not installed up againts each
        other, and the upright only supports the bearings from inside. A face-to-face arangement would make the 
        bearings vulnerable to axial loads.

      <h3>Appendix 6: FEA results interpretation</h3>
      <p>Extensive simulations were performed on the components to ensure that they will be able to withstand the forces
        during the car's operation.The load cases used were set to be the theoretical maximum performance of the car, 
        given its physical properties and tyre data.  The concept of traction circle is often used to describe the 
        performance envelope of racing vehicles, and it is possible to calculate forces from the maximum acceleration 
        figures. However, FSAE cars are characterized by their abundance of cornering capabilities and lack of power, 
        and the traction circles often look more like an ellipse with the positive longitudinal G being much lower than 
        braking and cornering. 
      </p>
      <p>Specific to the rear hubs, the effect of tripod torque was simulated. This caused the simulation runtime to 
        increase from 20 min per load case to over 1 hr, which is why it was only performed at the start and the end of 
        the design process to avoid slowing down interations. This is due to the addition of multiple sliding contacts 
        and the requirement to use fine mesh at the tripod contacts.
      </p>

      <p>In our simulation, acceleration is set to be 1 G, Cornering at 2 G and Braking at -1.8 G. 
        These are not sustainable figures, but they 
        do show up as peaks in test run data. Spring and tyres are also not considered due to limited simulations 
        capabilities, making the conditions even harsher. As mentioned in the main body, both the rear hub and rear 
        preload plate could not achieve FOS 2.0, but this is under the most extreme load case where the suspension 
        is subjected to a 3 G bump, corners at 2 G and accelerates at 1 G. This is well outside the traction circle, but 
        the load case is still used to gauge how well the design will hold up during accidents such as curb strikes.

      <h3>Appendix 7: NPT standard</h3>
      <p>NPT stands for National Pipe Thread, which is a thread standard from the US. It is characterized by its tapered thread and requires the used
        of PTFE sealing tape.
